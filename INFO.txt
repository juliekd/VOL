After developing our software and interface, we have started running studies in participants.
Initial findings show that using audio reduction increases the accuracy of hearing when compared to the baseline, 
and are  starting to show a trend towards immediate audio reduction. Participants are finding audio reduction unintrusive,
but only show positive interest in certain use cases.  
Our next steps are to complete further user studies and analyze the larger resulting data set.
